You can review the logic for setting up the next term in the 220.txt file.
//at start of new term, these tables must be updated: OL_MasterCourse, OL_Textbooks, OL_MasterExams,OL_buildingBlocks, OL_Progress
    We need to add the data to these tables for the next term master coursesl
//I have created the sql scripts (for the 2215 term) in the folder 2215StartupScripts.txt  
    I'd suggest creating a new folder and set of files for each term and run them seperately to have a record of what has been modified in the db.
These could be simplified by ganging the sql commands together into one long command, but I prefer to run each script  for each table manually.
   this forces me to think through the entire process in case there is an error.

   The basic process is:
   1.  Backup the table
   2. Create a temp table getting only the data for the past term.
   3. Modify the data in the temp table to refelct the new term parameters/names
   6. Delete the ID column from the temp table
   5. Copy the temp table (with the new records) into original table to add records for the upcoming terrn.
      Rinse and repeat for each of the tables.

   Admins no longer add new courses to the DB or change the status of a course from pilot to active. (Desigers do that)
   New courses are to be added by the designers from the New course Wizard
   ~Designer/NewCourseWizard.aspx   The designer link is found in the desiger app on the Designer EditMyCourses tab.   ~Designer/EditMyCourses.aspx

   To handle Designer assignments, I run the ~Administrator/Admin/ChangeDeveloperOne.aspx file after preparing a CSV from Dr. Burt that associates all courses with the new designer assignments.
 
  You can change one course at t time or upload the data to  ~ Administrator,Admin/Data/DesignerChange.csv
        2205_EAP1600_MC_VC,EAP1600,A Alphonse-Prescott,124
        2205_EAP1600L_MC_VC,EAP1600L,A Alphonse-Prescott,124
		 etc.

********************************* BEFORE RELEASING TO DESIGNERS**************************************************
		 You MUST update the DesignModule.vb file in the root directory
		 This is the master class file for the application that returns the correct name and definitions for the running app.
		 ThisTerm, NextTerm, NewMasterterm are defined here and shared throughtout the application

		 NOTE on adding the proctored exam dates to the OL_MasterProctor table
		 Generally, I get the exam dates for the next term AFTER the Designer app is set up for the designers.
		 Dr Burt sends a list of courses and exam dates as a spreadsheet  This is saved to a csv. to the Data folder in this directory
		 Then use the Add_OL_Masterproctor.aspx to add the dates
